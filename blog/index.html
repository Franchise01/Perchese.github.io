                    <p>It may come as no surprise to you that many people don't believe in the delicious dish that is Orange chicken. As generations pass, people tend to forget the pionnering techniques that built this country. Ignorant people like this woman here believe that Orange chicken is just regular ass chicken mixed with artificial orange flavoring. Well I'm here to tell you that they are all wrong. <strong>This woman</strong> is esspecially wrong. She thinks Orange chicken comes from factories. She is so spoiled with city living and modern technological advancments she doesn't even know about the Orange chicken farms.</p>
                    <p>Do you not know about the Orange chicken farms either? Do not fret you silly little girl or boy. That just means you're an extremly sheltered individual yoursel. Think about maybe exploring different lifestyles and learn a thing or two. For now, I'll give your brain a lecture on the important things such as agriculture, living off the land, and the legendary fauna. The Orange chicken which has been a delicacy in American cuisine for nearly hundreds of years. Though it's styled after Chinese food, the Orange chicken is not indigenous to China, so it's possible that the American decendants of Chinese immigrants found the incredible creature and developed a recipie using its sweet and tangy Orange flavored meat.</p>

                    <h3>What Is Orange Chicken?</h3>
                    <p>Orange chicken is a breed of chicken specifically designed for human consumption. When you look into the eyes of an orange chicken you are not taken aback by the moral ramifications of eating a living creature because the orange chicken knows in it's heart that it was meant to be livestock, and when it looks at you, you feel a sense of security, and both of you know that just as the orange chicken will be inside you, you will also be inside the orange chicken. Orange chickens do not lay eggs. That is an inefficent method of breeding. Instead, they were genetically modified to reproduce asexually every six hours or so.</p>
                    <p>After two reproductions, the Orange chicken dies naturally, and preserves it's flavor in its soft delicious skin. Now obviously Orange chicken farms would be overflowing with Orange chickens if they kept every two chickens that a singular Orange chicken produced, so a solution comes about. You don't have to wait for the Orange chicken to die to prepare for consumption, but the maximum flavor is lost on the chicken if you don't wait until full maturity. Orange chicken farmers take as many as they can hold, and then they kill the rest. Properly prepared and fully mature chickens are given to select Chinese buffets, and small Chinese themed American restauraunts, while the young premature chickens are given to Panda Express to feed to their slop gobbling ****** customers who would probably eat anything labeled as "ethnic" food.</p>

                    <h3>Are You Convinced Yet?</h3>
                    <p>Orange chicken is the crux of eating. Its health benefits are unlike any other. You may think otherwise because you generally consume the cheap Orange chicken given to those who need a cheap fix, but if you ever find yourself to be lucky enough to consume real properly matured Orange chicken, your whole world view will be changed.</p>
                    <p>The question on everybodys mind, and I find it interesting if you find yourself asking this, does Orange chicken cure cancer? The answer is yes it absolutly does. Orange chicken cures and treats all forms of cancer, sexually transmitted diseases, and even diabetes if treated with enough doses.</p>
                    <p>How do you prepare Orange chicken? For the chicken that dies naturally it's a relativly easy process. Their feathers and extra bits fall out on their own, even the meat falls right off the bone. For other Orange chickens who have to be killed by force, you must pluck off each individual feather of the Orange chicken while it shreiks in pain. This is because if you kill them prematurly, the feathers release a toxin into the meat powerful enough to kill 50 people. Then the meat and bones are grinded up into one gooey substance and breaded, and covered with the blood of the orange chicken which is the Orange chicken sauce you may be familiar with.</p>

                    <p>This is what it looks like when someone consumes improperly prepared Orange chicken.
